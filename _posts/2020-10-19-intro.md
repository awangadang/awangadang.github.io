Hello World! I'm totally new to blogging, so pardon my inexperience. I have no idea why you're reading this, but if I had to guess, it might be because you want to gain some new perspective. My motivations to blog are two-fold. One, to document and record what I've learned as I grind and level up new skills. Two, to improve my writing skills.
