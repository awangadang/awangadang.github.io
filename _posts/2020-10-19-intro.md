# Introducing Myself
Hello World! I'm totally new to blogging, so pardon my inexperience. I have no idea why you're reading this, but if I had to guess, it might be because you want to gain some new perspective. My motivations to blog are two-fold. One, to document and record what I've learned as I grind and level up new skills. Two, to improve my writing skills. This blog is a promise that I made to myself to commit to always making progress and learning new things.

# Meta Learning
Next I'm going to talk about some of the techniques I'm using to learn. I have to admit that I haven't been good at self-motivation, nor discipline. As a result, I've developed some techniques to ensure that I'm on track. I use a time tracker called Clockify to track each of the topics I'm tackling. It gives me a good grasp over how much time I've committed and my overall progress. I'm a staunch believer in putting in the time. In my experience, most of my failures come from lack of time and effort. I also recommend researching about **deep work**. It's important to set aside a contiguous block of time when you're trying to do actual work, as constant outside distractions or breaks will disrupt focus.

# In Closing
I want this blog to be an outlet for me to express myself and my work. I hope that my output brings new perspectives to you, the reader, and also gives you motivation in your work.
